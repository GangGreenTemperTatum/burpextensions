BurpToRepeater aim's to log all of the Burp Suite history of request's and responses, generated specifically from the Repeater tab into the **Proxy** > **HTTP History** tab.

The reason for doing so, is that sometimes when testing, you may need to slightly alter a request or could perhaps get different results, depending on a fix implementation or just during testing.

With BurpToRepeater, you have all records of those HTTP requests and responses saved which allows you to verify and re-use historical events from yee old Repeater.

Ensure Jython standalone jar to import it into an application, as Burp Suite is written in Java Burp Suite Extender API Documentation
